7-2-2011 - OpenVAS-Client 3.x compatibility release

This release fixes an OpenVAS-Client 3.x compatibility issue reported and
fixed
by Brad Alexander

Frank,

Please find the attached do-scan script. The problem was that OpenVAS-clients
versions 2 and before as well as nessus (all versions that I was able to test)
use -v to determine the version, whereas OpenVAS-Client version 3 (and
presumably version 4, which is in alpha/beta now) uses -V

As a quick fix, I reversed the test, so that it tests for nessus rather than
openvas-client, as follows

Is it nikto? -> yes -> run nikto test
  | no
 V
Is it nessus? -> yes -> run nessus
  |
 V
It's openvas -> run openvas

Note that I have the following versions of the tools to test against:
OpenVAS-Client -> 2.0.5, 3.0.0 (server version 3.0.4) Nessus -> 2.2.10, 4.2.2
and 4.4.0

In any case, let me know your comments on my changes. I can send you a diff
file, if you prefer, when I get home. The license, obviously, on my changes
are gpl, but I got bitten on not specifically stating that on my blog.

Thanks,
--b
